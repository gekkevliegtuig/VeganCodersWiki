# Unfair Fishing Practices

- European-owned longliner, involved in overfishing on a global
  scale by fishing on depleted stocks of yellowfin tuna and
  swordfish in the South Pacific.
- Active in high seas areas in the Southern Pacific, which lack
  environmental governance
- Crew reportedly claim to be in debt bondage. They claim to earn
  around €260 a month. Crew members have stated that they are the
  poorest paid of all the fishermen in the world. On board they are
  served the same meal each day: fish bait - frozen pieces of
  mackerel and squid. Their Indonesian passports have been seized.
- Three crew members claim to have had serious accidents and had
  suffered numbness to arms and hands, without receiving proper
  medical treatment.
