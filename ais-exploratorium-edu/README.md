# Exploratorium.edu San Francisco Bay Area AIS feed

Here is about a day worth of AIS messages (~600k msgs) from a live AIS feed at
http://ais.exploratorium.edu/ 

This covers only a small region. It's compressed to ~7 MB and decompressed into ~30 MB.

ps. besides a live AIS feed, they also have nice videos :-) http://exploratorium.edu/explore/videos/
